    Remove buildling docs from 'install' and 'all' targets.
    
    Doc depends on yodl, which is not currently packaged.
    Adding yodl would mean adding icmake.
    icmake's current version (12.00.01) is tagged wrong
    in their repo.  So the only option there would be to
    build the old (12.00.00) version, which would then get complaints from
    the updater.
    
    So, for now, just don't build the Docs.
